# This file is only used by the moonraker setup, not OctoPrint!
# OctoPrint uses the package list in the setup.py file.
#
# BUT, for the most part, the packages should be exactly synced between these sources.
# The only excpetion would be any packages moonraker or OctoPrint depend upon, that the other doesn't.
#
# For comments on package lock versions, see the comments in the setup.py file.

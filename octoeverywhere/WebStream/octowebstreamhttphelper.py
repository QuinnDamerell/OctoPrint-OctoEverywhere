    # until the full amount of data requested is read. That doesn't work for things like event streams, because there's no boundary string and the full length is unknown,
    # but we want to stream the data as it arrives to us. To make doBodyRead efficient, we request a large read buffer, so if the event stream contains many small messages,
    # doBodyRead will block until it accumulates enough messages to fill the full buffer and send it.
    #
    # For normal requests with known content lengths, response.raw.read will read full buffers until the full content is known to be done, and then will return the final subset buffer,
    # so they can't get blocked like streaming event can. So if the event stream isn't sending data often, this can get stuck while waiting for the final bytes of a message.

    # Thus, this function does many small reads (which isn't as efficient) but builds them into a larger buffer that's time limited. In this way, we ensure we are still streaming
    # messages every x amount of time, but we also don't stream super small data packets.
    #
    # Note this logic will always have a "one message" latency due to the way we get blocked on the socket. Even though we read small amounts, there's no way to know the full message
    # length, and thus there's no way to ask for only the remainder of the message. Thus, the end of the message will usually always get put into a pending read, but that read will block
    # until the buffer is filled the rest of the way with the n+1 message. Unfortunately that means we are always a message or so behind in the stream. Without being able to do a non-blocking request read,

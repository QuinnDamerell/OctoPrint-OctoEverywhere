# This class is responsible for doing updates for all plugins and companions on this local system.
# This update logic is mostly for companion plugins, since normal plugins will be updated via the moonraker update system.
# But it does work for both.
#
# However, this is quite easy, for a few reasons.
#    1) All plugins and companions will use the same ~/octoeverywhere/ git repo.
#          All Creality based installs will use /usr/shared/octoeverywhere
#    2) We always run the ./install.sh script before launching the PY installer, which handles updating system packages and PIP packages.
#
# So all we really need to do is find and restart all of the services.

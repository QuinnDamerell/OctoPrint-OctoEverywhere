# 
# This class is responsible for connecting and maintaining a connection to a server.
# This includes making manaing all of the websocket connections and making sure they are cleaned up
# Handling disconnects, errors, backoff, and retry logic.
# Handling RunFor logic which limits how long a server connection stays active.
#
class OctoServerConV0:

    # The RunFor system allows the host to specify how long this server connection should be active.
    # This time includes all valid connections and disconnects. Simply put, after x amount of time, the class
    # should be cleaned up and RunBlocking will return.
    #
    # This functionally is used to occasionally make the printer refresh it's primary server, because over time the
    # best server connection might change. When the server reconnects it will resolve printer connect hostname again
    # which will route it to the best server.
    # This feature is also used for secondary connections, which allows the printer to connect ot multiple servers at once.
    # Secondary server connections are used when a shared connection url resolves to a different server than we are currently connected.
    #
    # The run for system accounts for user activity, and will allow extra time after the run for time if the user is still using the 
    # connection.

    # How frequency we check if RunFor is done.

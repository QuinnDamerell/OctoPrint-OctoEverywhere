# A class that manages the local auth rights of OctoEverywhere.
#
# To keep OctoEverywhere as secure as possible, we never store OctoPrint access data in our services.
# This keeps multiple layers of security as a bad actor would have to gain remote access to the printer via OctoEverywhere
# and then also gain OctoPrint credentail access.
#
# So the plugin will try to establish an app key for itself to use for API calls. The plugin has full access to these systems internally
# but using the API calls makes the flow for the service to use the APIs easier. When a special http request message is sent from the server,
# the plugin will add the app key auth headers to the call. Since the server's validity has been secured by the RSA challenge, we know that only,
# OctoEverywhere servers are able to set the flag to make the requests.
#
# We use an plugin hook that only exists since OctoPrint 1.3.6. If this is running on older versions our authed calls will fail because we won't get the
# ValidateApiKey callback. Less than 2% of all global OctoPrint instances are running 1.3.12

# On 4/13/2023 we updated to only support PY3, which frees us up from a lot of package issues. A lot the packages we depend on only support PY3 now.
#
# websocket_client
# 	For the websocket_client, some older versions seem to have a thread issue that causes the 24 hour disconnect logic to fail, and eventually makes the thread limit get hit.
# 	Version 1.4.0 also has an SSL error in it. https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues/857
#	Update: We also found a bug where the ping timer doesn't get cleaned up: https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/pull/918
#   Thus we need version 1.6.0 or higher.
# dnspython
#	We depend on a feature that was released with 2.3.0, so we need to require at least that.
#
# Other lib version notes:
#   pillow - We don't require a version of pillow because we don't want to mess with other plugins and we use basic, long lived APIs.\
#   certifi - We use to keep certs on the device that we need for let's encrypt. So we want to keep it fresh.
#   rsa - OctoPrint 1.5.3 requires RAS>=4.0, so we must leave it at 4.0.
#   httpx - Is an asyncio http lib. It seems to be required by dnspython, but dnspython doesn't enforce it. We had a user having an issue that updated to 0.24.0, and it resolved the issue.
#   urllib3 - There is a bug with parsing headers in versions older than 1.26.? (https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm/issues/269). At least 1.26.6 fixes it, ubt we decide to just stick with a newer version.
#
# Note! These also need to stay in sync with requirements.txt, for the most part they should be the exact same!
